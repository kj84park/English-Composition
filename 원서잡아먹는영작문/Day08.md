# The Miser and His Gold by Aesop

### 한 구두쇠가 그의 금들을 그의 정원의 한 비밀공간에 묻었다.

### 매일 그는 장소에 가서, 보물을 파냈고 하나하나 세었다.

### 그의 일꾼중 한명이 그의 빈번한 그 장소로의 방문을 관찰하고, 바로 숨겨진 보물의 비밀을 발견하였다.

### 한 저녁 그는 조용히 보물을 파내고, 그것을 훔쳤다.

### 구두쇠가 그의것을 잃은것을 알아차렸을때, 그는 슬픔과 절망에 빠져들었다.

### 그는 울었고 그의 머리를 잡아 뜯었다.

### 지나가던 행인이 그의 울음소리를 들었고 무슨일인지 물었다.

### "나의 금! 오 나의 금" 울던 구두쇠는 "누군가 나의 것을 강탈해갔소!"

### "당신의 금이 저 구멍에? 왜 당신은 그것을 저기에 넣어놨었소?" 행인이 말했다.

### "왜 당신은 그것을 집에 보관하지 않았소오? 당신은 무언가를 살때 그것을 사용할수 있지 않소오"

### "구매!" 구두쇠는 화가나서 소리쳤다. "왜 나는 그 금을 사용한적이 없소. 나는 그것을 쓴다는 생각을 한적이 없소"

### 행인은 큰돌을 들고 그것을 구멍으로 던져 넣었다.

### "만약 이렇다면" 그는 말했다. "상상해라 금이 계속 저기 묻혀있는것을"

###  그 돌은 당신이 금이라고 여긴다면 그만큼 유용할 것이다.
