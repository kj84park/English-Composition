# A Gathering: Chicago by Spencer Johnson

### 한 시카고의 맑은 일요일에, 몇명의 이전 같은반 친구들, 학교에서 좋은 친구들이었던, 점심식사를 위해 모였다, 고등학교 동창회를 위한 모임을 했다. 밤 이전에.

### 그들은 각자의 인생안에 무슨일들이 있었는지를 더 듣기를 원했다.

### 많은 농담이후에, 그리고 좋은 음식, 그들은 흥미로운 대화를 본격적으로 하기 시작했다.

### 앤젤라, 그 반에서 가장 인기많은 사람중 하나였던, 말했다, "삶은 확실히 다르게 모습을 드러낸다 우리가 학교에 있을때 생각했던 것과는."

### "많은것이 변했어"

### "확실히 그래" 네이선이 공감했다. 그들은 알았다 그는 그의 집의 사업을 하러 갔었다, 이것은 꽤 잘 굴러갔었고, 그들이 기억하는 오랫동안 지역 사회의 일부분과 마찬가지 였다.

### 그래서 그들은 놀랐다. 그가 걱정했을때. 그는 물었다 "그런데 너는 알고있었니 어떻게 우리가 변화를 원하지 않았다는것을?"

### 카를로스는 말했다 "나는 짐작한다 우리는 변화를 저항했다 왜냐하면 우리는 변화를 두려워 했었으니까"
