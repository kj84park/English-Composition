# Sleeping Beauty by Charles Perrault

### 옛날 옛적 아름다운 아기 딸을 가진 여왕이 있었다.

### 그녀는 세례식에 왕국의 모든 요정들을 초대했다. 그렇지만 불행히도 소량의 한 마녀를 초대하는것을 잊었다.

### 그녀는 어쨌든 왔고, 그렇지만 그녀는 아기의 요람을 지나가며, 말했다: "네가 16살이 되면, 너는 물레가락에 스스로를 부상입히고 죽을것이다"

### "오 안돼!" 여왕은 공포에 소리쳤다. 착한 요정이 재빨리 저주를 바꾸기위해, 주문을 읊조렸다.

### "그녀가 스스로를 상처낼때, 그 여자아이는 죽는대신 깊은 잠에 빠져들것이다"

### 많은 해가 지났다. 작은 공주는 자랐고, 전체 왕국안에서 가장 아름다운 여자가 되었다.

### 그녀의 어머니는 언제나 매우 조심했다. 물레가락으로 부터 멀리 떨어져있게 하려고

### 하지만, 그녀의 16번째 생일에, 공주는, 그녀는 성 사이를 배회하다, 어떤 늙은 하인이 실타레를 돌리고 있는 방으로 들어갔다.

### "여기서 뭐해?" 그녀는 하인에게 물었다.

### "돌리고 있지, 실타래를 이전에 본적이 있니?"

### "아니 한번 보자"
