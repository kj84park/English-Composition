# The Lion and the Mouse by Aesop

### 한 사자가 평화롭게 자고있는 중에 사자는 무언가가 그의 위아래에서 달리는것 때문에 잠에서 깼다.

### 사자는 느리게 그의 한쪽눈을 떴고 작은 쥐를 보았다.

### 사자는 번개같은 속도로 작은 생물을 그의 거대한 발톱으로 잡았고, 그녀를 먹기위해 그의 거대한 턱을 열었다.

### "제발 제발 먹지 마세요" 불쌍한 쥐는 애원했다.

### "제발 나를 보내주세요 그리고 어느날 저는 반드시 되갚겠습니다. "

### "그것은 내가 들었던 것중 가장 재밌는 것이구나!" 사자는 웃으며 말했다.

### 계속 웃으면서, 그는 쥐를 바닥에 내려놓았고 말했다.

### "너는 계속 나를 많이 웃게 만들었기 때문에 나는 너를 지금 먹을수 없다 내 맘이 변하기 전에 가거라"

### 몇일이 지나고, 사자는 숲속에서 그의 사냥감에게 몰래 다가가는 중, 사냥꾼에게 붙잡혔다.

### 그들은 그를 강한 끈으로 땅에서 묶었다.

### 작은 쥐는 근처에 있었고, 사자의 도움을 요청하는 포효를 듣고 다가 왔다.

### 쥐는 그녀의 날카로운 이로 끈을 갉았고 사자를 자유롭게 만들었다.

### "당신은 웃었다 내가 당신에게 은혜를 갚겠다고 했을때" 쥐는 말했다.

### "지금 당신이 보는것 처럼 심지어 쥐도 사자에게 도움을 줄수 있다."
