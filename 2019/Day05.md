# The Hare and the Tortoise by Aesop

### 옛날 옛적 어느날, 어떻게 그렇게 빠를수 있는지 빠르게 달리는 토끼가 있었다. 그는 거북이가 굉장히 느린것을 비웃었다.

### 거북이는 굉장히 화가 났다. 그는 토끼에게 경주를 도전했다.

### 여우가 경주의 심판이 되고, 모든 숲속의 동물들이 보기위해 모였다. 경주가 시작될때, 토끼는 그 순간을 무시했다.

### 그는 거북이를 되돌아보고 소리쳤다. 어떻게 네가 경주를 이길수 있을거라 예상하느냐 너는 그렇게 느리게 걸으면서?

### 반이상의 거리를 달린 후, 토끼는 지루해지기 시작했다. 거북이가 뒤에서 조용했었기 때문에, 토끼는 낮잠을 자기로 결정했다.

### 반면에 거북이는 한걸음 한걸음 걷기를 유지했다.

### 그는 절대 멈추지 않았고 계속 갔다.

### 토끼가 깨어났을때, 거북이는 시야에 없었다. 그는 다시 뛰기 시작했다. 그러나 이것은 너무 늦었다.

### 거북이는 이미 결승점을 지나있었다.
